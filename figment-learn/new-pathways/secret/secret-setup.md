# Set your Datahub API key

The value for `DATAHUB_SECRET_API_KEY` can be found on the [**DataHub Services Dashboard**](https://datahub.figment.io/services/secret). Click on the **Secret** icon in the list of available protocols and then copy your key as shown below. You can now paste your personal API key into `.env.local`. This will authenticate you and enable you to make JSON-RPC requests to Secret via DataHub.
