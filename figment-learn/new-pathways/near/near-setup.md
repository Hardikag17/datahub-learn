# Set your Datahub API key

The value for `DATAHUB_NEAR_API_KEY` can be found on the [DataHub Services Dashboard](https://datahub.figment.io/services/near). Click on the **NEAR** icon in the list of available protocols and then copy your key as shown below. You can now paste your personal API key into `.env.local`. This will authenticate you and enable you to make JSON-RPC requests to NEAR via DataHub.
